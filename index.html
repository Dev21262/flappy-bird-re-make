    In 2021. With 0 experience of making games. I created a game in PJS called Flappy Bird Remake. It got 37 votes and I was very disappointed. Back then Much of the game's logic was written by Gray Wolf who helped me. He is one of the reasons I could continue coding else I would have give up. Today I feel good to have remade the remake in HTML5 and Javascript.
    
    I reused the pixel arts of Flappy, Pipes and Gray Wolf Bird which I had created in 2021. 
    
    Features:
        12 Characters
        Leaderboard - (Spinoff prove needed)
        W/S Keys are used to navigate in leaderboard
        The game has been made difficult (comparable to the Original) 
        There is also a version where I have divided the code into different files
